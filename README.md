# apps script form generator
This is some code I wrote with Google Apps Script to help my mom turn her spreadsheets into a Google Form more easily. I'm just putting this on here as an example of my code, rather than as something to actually be used, so there won't be instructions on how to run it. I've added an example of the spreadsheet that it reads the menu data from.
